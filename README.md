# U.S-STATES-DATA-EXAMPLE.-Rank-US-states-and-territories-by-their-2012-population-density.
Merge and join operations come up most often when one is combining data from different sources. Here we will consider an example of some data about US states and their populations. The data files can be found at http://github.com/jakevdp/data-USstates/: Given this information, say we want to compute a relatively straightforward result: rank US states and territories by their 2012 population density. We clearly have the data here to find this result, but weâ€™ll have to combine the datasets to get it.
